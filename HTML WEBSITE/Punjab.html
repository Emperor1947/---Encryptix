When the mist, fog, and cold waves cast their spell on earth on the longest winter night, the sacred fire of Lohri is lit to reach the skies. Sesame seeds, jaggery, and all things that provide warmth to the human body are offered to the fire and the loud and exuberant folk music and dance of the people fill the air with festive spirit. Lohri celebration in Punjab takes place because it is believed that after Lohri, the days start to become longer and warmer.

Significance: It is the winter harvest festival. It is said that the Sun God is invoked through the Lohri songs seeking warmth. The lore also has it that the day is celebrated in remembrance of the benevolent Dulla Bhatti who saved Hindu girls from being abducted by the Mughals. One of the popular themes of Lohri songs includes the mention of two girls thus saved by Dulla Bhatti named Sundari & Mundri.
Key attraction: The main highlight of this important festival of Punjab is the bonfire and the folk songs and danced that take place around the fire. People go around the fire and put all the produce of the winter harvest into the fire that includes gurh, gachak, sesame seeds, and other dry fruits. The same is distributed among the people which further leads to a grand feast with a delectable table spread including traditional dishes such as Til Rice, Makki di roti, and Sarson da saag among others
