Holi is a colorful festival popular in most parts of the country, and Uttar Pradesh also observes the festival of Holi with a lot of enthusiasm. Barsana Holi, on the other hand, is an innovative style of celebrating Holi, particularly in the small town of Barsana of Uttar Pradesh. Barsana is the birthplace of Radha, the beloved of Lord Krishna, and is in the district of Mathura.  
The distinctive quality of this festival is the mock fight that the women of Barsana engage in with the men of Nandgaon, a neighboring town. The men of Nandgaon come to take over the Shri Radhikaji Temple of Barsana. The women of Barsana try to stop them with bamboo sticks, and the men cannot strike the women with anything other than colors. The men who are made to dress up in women’s clothes and dance in front of everybody. All of these take place in the right, happy spirit. Throughout the festival, songs of conversation between Krishna and Radha are a must. The Barsana Holi is a jolly representation of the treatment of Lord Krishna from the hands of the adoring Gopias. The festival is also known as Lathmar Holi. This festival is primitive to Uttar Pradesh.

The land and its people celebrate the happy event with many activities, recitals of Lord Krishna’s numerous tales, and even sports.  

Dahi Handi is an indigenous sport or entertainment that is ubiquitously in association with the festival of Janmashtami. All the people of a colony come together to take part in this event of breaking the Dahi Handi, a clay pot with yogurt that hangs from a string up in the air. Young boys form a human pyramid and climb to the top to break the pot. Meanwhile, the onlookers throw colors at the participants. This is an enjoyable activity that one must witness at least once. People of Uttar Pradesh pay more attention to ensuring such activities take place smoothly and with a lot of delight during Janmashtami.
